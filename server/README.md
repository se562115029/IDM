You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`Expressjs`]([https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html]) to define routing.

and [`Prisma`] [(https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/postgresql)] to ORM to facilitate database interaction.
